    "\n",
    "<p align=\"justify\">The overall goal of the workshop is to introduce participants to multiscale spatial modeling and engage in a discussion of the scale of geographic processes and their measurement. Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) is a cutting-edge modeling technique which integrates both nomothetic and ideographic approaches in geography and allows a more nuanced interpretation of place and space. Participants will be introduced to the field of local modeling and the opportunities it presents to measure the scale at which geographic processes operate. Participants will also complete hands-on training in the use of MGWR in research, and will be encouraged to use the provided code for their own future research.</p>\n"
